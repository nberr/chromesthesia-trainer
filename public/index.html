        <h3>How to practice</h3>
        <p class="wrapperpara">
            First of all, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOGGED IN. Your quiz results will NOT be logged if you are not logged
             in.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Visit the practice tab. Get familiar with the different intervals. You can ignore the root for now.
                    Intervals will sound similar regardless of the root.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Read the FAQ. I've listed a few things that helped me. If you have suggestions to help other users,
                    send me an email and I'll add them!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take the assessment quiz. Do this after you are familiar with the intervals. Test yourself for 30
                    minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take the quiz. Make sure to test yourself for 10-15 minutes per day. If you don't think you'll
                    remember to take the test, set an alarm to remind yourself. If you're feeling motivated you can take
                     the test multiple times per day but try to keep each session 10-15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the experiment is over, take the assessment test again!
